Hi, this is Hangman.

You are a random dude in the sacred Brilliantland. You have been kidnapped and whether you come out alive or not depends on your guessing skill.

There are a lot of alternate endings, some depend on randomness, and some are very specific.

In order to play this game, the first step is to install a python module called colorama. This can be done by typing this in the terminal:

pip install colorama

or

pip3 install colorama (if the previous doesn't work)

or

python -m pip install colorama (if the previous doesn't work)

or

python3 -m pip install colorama (if the previous doesn't work)
